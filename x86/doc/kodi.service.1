.SH NAME
\fBkodi-xxx.service \fP- Systemd service units to run Kodi in standalone mode without the need for a DE.
\fB
.SH DESCRIPTION
Systemd service units to run kodi in standalone mode using X11, GBM, or Wayland.
.PP
Provided services are:
.IP \(bu 3
/usr/lib/systemd/system/kodi-x11.service
.IP \(bu 3
/usr/lib/systemd/system/kodi-gbm.service
.IP \(bu 3
/usr/lib/systemd/system/kodi-wayland.service
.SH NOTES ON SYSTEM SHUTDOWN/REBOOT
Be aware that these services run Kodi in systemd's user.slice not in the system.slice. In order to have Kodi gracefully exit, the system should be called to shutdown or to reboot using the respective Kodi actions not by a call to systemctl.
.PP
This is NOT recommended:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        # systemctl reboot

.fam T
.fi
If you do reboot or shutdown via a call to systemctl, this will result in systemd killing the cg too quickly and data loss to your Kodi profile will occur. When Kodi exits cleanly, it will save GUI settings, media settings, Kodi uptime etc. In principal this is no different than data loss occurring from a user doing work when a sysadmin issues a reboot command without prior warning. While it is possible to run Kodi in systemd's system.slice instead, doing so makes it difficult to use USB mounts within Kodi and to use pulseaudio for Kodi sessions.
.SH RECOMMENDED METHODS TO SHUTDOWN/REBOOT
Here are several options:
.IP \(bu 3
Select the corresponding option under Power menu in the Kodi GUI.
.IP \(bu 3
Use the official Android/iOS remote app.
.IP \(bu 3
If a CLI option is preferred, use kodi-send to issue the command to reboot or shutdown like so:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
        $ kodi-send -a "Reboot"
        $ kodi-send -a "ShutDown()"

.fam T
.fi
Note that kodi-send may not be included with your Distro's kodi package. For example, on Arch Linux, it is provided by the kodi-\fB-eventclients\fP package.
.SH PASSING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO THE SERVICE
Should the need arise, one can pass environment variables to the service by creating /etc/conf.d/kodi-standalone and populating it with the needed variables.
